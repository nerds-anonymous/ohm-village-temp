OHM2013 village temperature log
===============================

Some dude on the [OHM camp](https://ohm2013.org/) distributed wireless temperature logging devices to various villages and provided the collected data in a simple html table on some webserver.

I logged this data and later created this graph using the collected data:

If you have more data or are the guy who created and distributed these devices, please drop me a mail.

Also, note how absolutely *cool* the **Darksystem village** was!!! :-)
